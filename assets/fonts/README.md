# SF Pro Display Fonts

This directory should contain the following font files:
- SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf
- SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf

## How to obtain the fonts

1. Visit Apple's Developer website: https://developer.apple.com/fonts/
2. Download the "SF Pro" font package
3. Extract the package and locate the SF Pro Display fonts
4. Copy the required font files (Regular and Bold) to this directory

## Alternative approach

If you cannot access Apple's fonts, consider using a similar font like:
- Roboto (included with Flutter)
- Open Sans (available on Google Fonts)

If using an alternative font, make sure to update the `pubspec.yaml` file accordingly.
